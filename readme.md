# Carriage Manager

This is the admin panel for controlling and logging of carriage hub data.

This web application was developed by Sam Mottley and is part of Sam's Microprocessors unit on his Electronics degree.

## Overview

The web application is a bare bones system, just enough to allow the architecture of the carriage monitoring to work and function.

Additional features other than bare bones are present to ensure the users specification is met.

Although the system lacks some much need and powerful tools the user interface is rather swish and makes it easy for the client to setup monitoring systems.

## Features

Below is a quick list of the features that the system currently has:

  * Adding of carriage monitoring system (wizard like setup)
  * Editing of current carriage monitoring system
  * Deleting of current carriage monitoring systems
  * Viewing of data for current carriage monitoring systems
  * Caching of data for current carriage monitoring systems
  * Downloading of cached data for current carriage monitoring systems
  * Auth all round (although needs user management)
